## Source

* `pinball.exe` from `Windows XP` (SHA-1 `2A5B525E0F631BB6107639E2A69DF15986FB0D05`) and its public PDB
* `CADET.EXE` 32bit version from `Full Tilt! Pinball` (SHA-1 `3F7B5699074B83FD713657CD94671F2156DBEDC4`)

## Tools used

`Ghidra`, `Ida`, `Visual Studio`

## What was done

* All structures were populated, globals and locals named.
* All subs were decompiled, C pseudo code was converted to compilable C++. Loose (namespace?) subs were assigned to classes.

## Compiling

Project uses `C++11` and depends on `SDL2` libs.

### On Windows

Download and unpack devel packages for `SDL2` and `SDL2_mixer`.\
Set paths to them in `CMakeLists.txt`, see suggested placement in `/Libs`.\
Compile with Visual Studio; tested with 2019.

### On Linux

Install devel packages for `SDL2` and `SDL2_mixer`.\
Compile with CMake; tested with GCC 10, Clang 11.\
To cross-compile for Windows, install a 64-bit version of mingw and its `SDL2` and `SDL2_mixer` distributions, then use the `mingwcc.cmake` toolchain.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/spacecadetpinball.svg)](https://repology.org/project/spacecadetpinball/versions) 

Some distributions provide a package in their repository. You can use those for easier dependency management and updates.

This project is available as Flatpak on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.k4zmu2a.spacecadetpinball).

### On macOS

Install XCode (or at least Xcode Command Line Tools with `xcode-select --install`) and CMake.

**HomeBrew**

You can easily install the build artifact by using `brew`.

```sh
brew tap draftbrew/tap
brew install --no-quarantine space-cadet-pinball
```

Be aware that the flag `--no-quarantime` will disable macOS's Gatekeeper during installation.

**Manual compilation:**

* **Homebrew**: Install the `SDL2`, `SDL2_mixer` homebrew packages.
* **MacPorts**: Install the `libSDL2`, `libSDL2_mixer` macports packages.

Compile with CMake. Ensure that `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` variable is set for either `x86_64` Apple Intel or `arm64` for Apple Silicon.

Tested with: macOS Big Sur (Intel) with Xcode 13 & macOS Montery Beta (Apple Silicon) with Xcode 13.

**Automated compilation:**

Run the `build-mac-app.sh` script from the root of the repository. The app will be available in a DMG file named `SpaceCadetPinball-<version>-mac.dmg`.

Tested with: macOS Ventura (Apple Silicon) with Xcode Command Line Tools 14 & macOS Big Sur on GitHub Runner (Intel) with XCode 13.

## Plans

* ~~Decompile original game~~
* ~~Resizable window, scaled graphics~~
* ~~Loader for high-res sprites from CADET.DAT~~
* ~~Cross-platform port using SDL2, SDL2_mixer, ImGui~~
* Full Tilt Cadet features
* Localization support
* Maybe: Support for the other two tables - Dragon and Pirate
* Maybe: Game data editor

## On 64-bit bug that killed the game

I did not find it, decompiled game worked in x64 mode on the first try.\
It was either lost in decompilation or introduced in x64 port/not present in x86 build.\
Based on public description of the bug (no ball collision), I guess that the bug was in `TEdgeManager::TestGridBox`
